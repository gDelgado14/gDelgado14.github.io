<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-71a18ca4-3f14-fe55-11d4-dd878f3008a7">I'm very excited to announce that just a few days ago I launched a landing page for my<a href="http://bykme.ca/register"> service</a>. I am looking to create a peer-to-peer bike sharing network where locals can rent out their bicycles and make supplemental income. On the other side of the spectrum, travellers and infrequent commuters will have access to a quick method of accessing a bike, rather than having to register for a membership and pay a fixed price for the current bike sharing systems all around the world.</p>

<p dir="ltr">I've also met two people interested in working with me on this venture thus far and have begun validating the idea by visiting local bike shops to see what they think.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Just yesterday I pitched the idea to a small group of tech and entrepreneurship enthusiasts (<a href="http://www.boltmade.com/">at Boltmade HQ</a>) and got some great feedback. Their thoughts allowed me to refine the business model and brought up some critical points for the sustainability of the business.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Today is the start of<a href="http://startupweekend.org/"> Startup Weekend as well</a> - a 54 hour event in which I'm sure I'll learn even more about myself and the viability of<a href="http://bykme.ca/register"> BykMe</a>. I hope to meet even more awesome people as well as another potential cofounder (fingers crossed).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Today also marked the start of<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/artificial-intelligence-uc-berkeleyx-cs188-1x-0"> UC Berkeley's Artificial Intelligence course</a>. If you have been reading my posts for a while now, you'll know that I put a stop to trying to go at it alone on<a href="http://giorgiodelgado.ca/restarting-for-efficiencys-sake/"> MIT's AI course</a> because of the lack of resources as well as community. Thanks to<a href="https://www.edx.org/"> edX's online platform</a>, I am provided with more resources as well as a community in which I can discuss problems and learn at a faster rate. This rids me of the unnecessary headaches of trying to learn a subject completely alone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I am well on my way to achieving the three goals I set out to accomplish by the end of the Winter. Those goals (<a href="http://giorgiodelgado.ca/self-development-challenge/">mentioned here</a>) are:</p>

<ul class="my-list">
<li>Become a proficient programmer</li>
<li>Begin understanding Artificial Intelligence methodologies</li>
<li>Learn how to create a product</li>
</ul>
