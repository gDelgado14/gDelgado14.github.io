title: Self-Development-Challenge-The-Plan
tags: posts 
---
In my previous post, I<a href="http://giorgiodelgado.ca/self-development-challenge/"> presented my goals</a> for the next four to eight months. In this post I will discuss the details of the plan and how I will go about becoming a self-taught programmer.
<h5 dir="ltr">Become a Proficient Programmer</h5>
<p dir="ltr">In order to become a good programmer, I not only need to understand a few languages' syntax but also the mentality behind programming (i.e. sorting algorithms and the plethora of concepts that can be demonstrated on any language).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Thankfully, I've already gone ahead and completed<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x"> CS50x</a> (less the final project), Harvard's introduction to computer science course which introduced me to a wide array of instrumental concepts, such as efficient algorithm design, recursion, hashing, etc... Learning about Artificial Intelligence will provide me the opportunity to expand on this knowledge.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Additionally, I'm just about halfway through on Udemy's popular<a href="https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course/?dtcode=z6mhCZF27avk"> Web Developer</a> course, which has taught me how to design this blog and understand web design concepts.</p>

<h5 dir="ltr">Become Knowledgeable in Artificial Intelligence</h5>
<p dir="ltr">What most people don't realize is that<a href="http://robohub.org/economics-and-the-foundations-of-artificial-intelligence/"> Economics has a lot to do with Artificial Intelligence</a>. Being an Economics major myself, it only makes sense to continue learning about a similarly interesting field.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In order to accomplish this, I will follow<a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/index.htm"> MIT's Artificial Intelligence course</a> on MIT Open Courseware where I will complete all homework assignments and exams. I will treat this course as if I were a student paying full tuition for this course. As such, I have also gone ahead and purchased the<a href="http://smile.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201533774/mitopencourse-20/ref=smi_www_rco2_go_smi_1968491462?_encoding=UTF8&amp;redirect=true&amp;tag=mitopencourse-20&amp;pf_rd_p=1968491462&amp;pf_rd_s=smile-campaign&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=0201533774&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=0E09WJDX9AGEDJ99ERA4"> required textbook off of Amazon</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Depending on how the next four months unfold, I may enrol in<a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ud675"> Georgia Tech's Machine Learning course</a> via Udacity in order to strengthen my understanding in this field.</p>

<h5 dir="ltr">Become Capable of Creating Software Products</h5>
<p dir="ltr">I've dropped all my university classes in order to focus solely on these goals for the next four months ... with one exception. I managed to sneak into<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/conrad-business-entrepreneurship-technology/undergraduate-students/undergraduate-courses#BET300"> University of Waterloo's Business Development course</a> where I will get to meet and hear form successful entrepreneurs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In this environment I will be able to ask as many questions as I want and flesh out my product ideas.</p>

<h5 dir="ltr">Extracurriculars</h5>
<p dir="ltr">I hope to write once a week once the New Year begins where I'll discuss my challenges, what I've learned, and even post some of my work.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Finally, I may even enter a<a href="http://www.up.co/communities/canada/waterloo/startup-weekend/5100"> few hackathons here and there</a>, where I'll undoubtedly be shown how much I still need to learn to even consider myself a competent programmer.</p>
