<h2><small>Artificial Intelligence</small></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Prior to beginning the<a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/assignments/MIT6_034F10_lab0.pdf"> first assignment</a> of MIT's Artificial Intelligence course, I had to decide which<a href="http://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/integrated-development-environment"> IDE</a> to choose from. After some<a href="http://pedrokroger.net/choosing-best-python-ide/"> light reading</a>, I was quite tempted to download<a href="http://www.wingware.com/"> WingWare</a> as it has some features that I really like such as setting breakpoints and walking line by line through code. But seeing as I have already taken an introductory programming class using<a href="https://eclipse.org/"> Eclipse</a>, I decided I rather just stay with my current IDE and just learn how to use Eclipse efficiently.</p>

<h2><small>Web Development / Programming Improvements</small></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Through Udemy's Web Development Course, I have been Exposed to HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and now<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/"> Twitter Bootstrap</a>. I'm about 70% done the course already - what remains now are some lessons on server-side tools and frameworks such as WordPress, Mobile-First websites, PHP, MySQL, and finally some lessons on APIs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As I proceed with the Artificial Intelligence course I'll also use resources such as<a href="http://www.diveintopython.net/"> DiveIntoPython</a> and<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/"> StackOverflow</a> to overcome my inevitable struggles.</p>

<h2><small>Tech Product Development</small></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Today marks my first day of class at University of Waterloo's business development course. Hopefully by the end of the next four months I'll have a solid understanding of the requirements needed to launch a tech product successfully.</p>
Cheers.
