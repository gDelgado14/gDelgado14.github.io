Time has flown by this summer.

In fact, it has been so long that I feel like I've lost my blogging mojo. I am on a quest to get it back. Back when I did my [forty-eight](/forty-eight/) hour project, my brain was firing at full speed. I want that feeling back again. 

This blog entry is simply an exercise in warming up once more to the habit of consistent blogging. A habit I can't recommend highly enough.

Expect good quality content to come from me soon. Mind you I've got a lot on my plate at the moment, although I'd prefer to keep it on the down low for the time being. 

This website will also be receiving a long-overdue makeover. I'm sorely lacking in CSS abilities. As such, I plan on implementing all of the CSS myself. 

Well, that's it for now, folks.
