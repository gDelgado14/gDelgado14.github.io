As mentioned in my [last post](/2017/01/12/goals-values.html), I want to gain a deeper understanding of Software and Technology in general. I never received formal education in software engineering. Despite this, I'm currently the only full-time engineer at [Homigo](http://www.homigo.com/). There's a lot of responsibility here as one mistake could cost us a lot of money and a lot of unhappy customers.

Beyond learning practical workplace skills, I'm also tickling my fancy, so to speak. I find computer science to be a fascinating yet highly challenging field that I'd like to learn more about.

As an entrepreneurial person, I also want to better equip myself for the next technology company that I start.

I've developed a set of challenges and sub-goals for this year. I already know I probably won't be able to achieve all of these things. After all, one of my other goals is to prioritize my finite time. This means that sometimes other equally-important things will prevent me from achieving one of these sub-goals. As I mentioned previously, I hope to complete half of the following items:

## Understand Networks

As a web developer I work every day with the interwebz. It's critical that I understand what's happening under the hood so as to make informed architectural decisions.

This challenge consists of:

- Completing the [Networking for Web Devs](https://www.udacity.com/course/networking-for-web-developers--ud256) course
- Completing the [Client-Server Communications](https://www.udacity.com/course/client-server-communication--ud897) course


## Contribute to an Open Source Project

I have been slacking very hard on this front. One area in particular that I am quite lazy in is reading other people's code. Contributing to an open source project would help me learn from others who are much more skilled and experienced than I am. 

As of now, I am not sure which project I am going to contribute to. There are so many. But in order for this challenge to be considered complete, my code must be integrated into the codebase of the project. 

From a quick search, I found [this](https://opensource.com/life/16/1/6-beginner-open-source) article which has already given me some ideas on what to contribute to. 

As someone who works daily with [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Grommet looks like super promising](https://grommet.github.io) project that I'd be curious to learn more about. This might actually be the project I choose to contribute to. I noticed they don't have an autocomplete component, so this could be a component I design for this library.

## Actually Use my Arduino and Raspberry Pi kits 

My love for technology is known to all. Because of this, I have been gifted several [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) and [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) kits. These are some of the best gifts I've ever gotten. The problem is, I've never taken the time to actually play around with them. 

So this year I resolve to change that.

## Redesign My Website

The goal of this is to improve my CSS skills and organize this website in a better way. 

One thing I currently don't like how I can't categorize posts and search for specific topics. 


## Understand Algorithms

> The prerequisite to this challenge is that I read about data structures

Algorithms are a core aspect of my job. But I lack the framework to think about an algorithms efficiency. I know the basics, but I don't feel satisfied knowing just the basics of this field. Proficiency in algorithm design and analysis is one of the pillars that compose a good engineer.

There are a few online classes that Udacity, edX, and Coursera have. I'll decide which to take once I feel ready to take the class. 

## Read Some Great Books

You'll know I've read these books when I post my notes to them here. 

#### Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja

This is the first book on my list, and one I've begun reading already.

#### Algorithms and Data Structures

There's a really good book offered for free online that I'd like to use as my reference for learning Data Structures. 

Its examples are written in Python, which is also a language that I'd like to understand better.

#### High Performance Browser Networking

This is [the seminal book](hpbn.co) on networking for web developers. It goes into great detail on what web devs should be aware of when working with the web applications. 


#### On JS Execution Context and Scope Chain

There is a [great 2-part series](http://davidshariff.com/blog/what-is-the-execution-context-in-javascript/) on the JavaScript Execution Context and its Scope Chain, which I find quite illuminating. This is must-know knowledge for JS devs.

#### On Containerization

Containers are a great way to manage inconsistencies across various software environments. They aren't the easiest things to understand at first, but with a few articles I'm sure I'll be up to speed. 


#### Code

[Charles Petzold's book](https://www.amazon.ca/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319) looks quite interesting. He starts with the basic building blocks of computing (binary data) to eventually creating a computer.

#### Learn You A Haskell

I've wanted to learn a functional programming language and thought since Haskell is so hipster, why not give it a shot. [The book](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) is also meant for programmers who have never tried functional programming. 

#### The Imposter's Handbook

[This book](https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook/) is intended for people like me - devs in industry who did not receive formal education in the field of computer science. It's meant to cover at a high level the key concepts of the field. 




 
## Wish List

These are resources I found online that I may one day read but am not actively focused on doing so any time soon.
