With my four month internship coming to an end, I have begun to rethink my priorities as well as my goals.

As April ends and May begins I will return to school to complete my third year of university. The combination of having a full course load, the ambition to undertake a personal venture, and the hope of redesigning my life in the aim of greater productivity all means that I will not have the time to write every other day like I have done for these past few months.

I've also felt like writing under an outlet with my name on it has emanated an essence of narcissism, hence why I haven't cared to market this website extensively. The enjoyment came strictly from knowing that I'm meeting the requirements of the goals I set out - mainly, to write something meaningful about anything every other day. As such, this website has been less of a blog and more of an exercise in discipline and creativity, and I've got to say that it was a challenging undertaking while it lasted.

Additionally, I believe that if you are someone who knows me personally, you'll instill a bias in whatever it is that I'm writing whether you like me or not. As the manifesto within the renown <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/">Zero Hedge</a> beautifully states:
<blockquote>... we believe in the critical importance of anonymity and its role in dissident speech. like the economist magazine, we also believe that keeping authorship anonymous moves the focus of discussion to the content of speech and away from the speaker- as it should be. we believe not only that you should be comfortable with anonymous speech in such an environment, but that you should be suspicious of any speech that isn't.</blockquote>
If you've been been suspicious of my public writing, as you so rightfully deserve to be, I commend you.

With all that said, I don't intend on extinguishing the burning desire to write altogether, I only wish to lessen its extent on my life for the time being. As of May, my writing will move to OnceAMonth, a venture by a <a href="http://jrdnbshp.com/">good friend of mine</a>, with the intention of strengthening relationships amongst those who care to stay in touch with me.

I'll delve into the details as May 1 approaches.
