In an effort to continue learning more about technology and keep my skills sharp (and save some moneyz), I'm going to migrate from <a href="https://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> to <a href="//jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> / <a href="//pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. 

This move also goes in tandem with my effort to become good with <a href="https://www.git-scm.com/">Git</a> / <a href="//github.com/">GitHub</a> so that I may have a public portfolio of my work down the road.

I just started playing around with <a href="//jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> a few days ago and it seems simple enough to pick up after a bit of reading. Here's what the site looks like <a href="https://gdelgado14.github.io/">right now</a> (this is the default bootstrap Jekyll deployment hosted via GitHub Pages).

Jekyll has a library that allows me to easily import Wordpress data directly into my blog but I feel like that's a learning opportunity foregone. Thankfully I found out about <a href="//scrapy.org/">Scrapy</a>; a Python web scraper. Hopefully I'll have some time to create a custom scraper that walks through the blog and have a nice clean JSON export feed that I can then convert to markdown. This already sounds overly ambitious ... but hey, why not shoot for the moon, right?
