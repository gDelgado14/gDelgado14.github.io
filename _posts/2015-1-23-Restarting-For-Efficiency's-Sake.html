<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-76f76c13-3f0c-cc77-f55c-418abf8a5e9e">If you've been following my posts, you'll know that I'm nearly one month into my<a href="http://giorgiodelgado.ca/self-development-challenge/"> self development challenge</a>, and I've got to say that there are some things I've learned along the way.</p>

<h2><small>MIT OpenCourseWare Makes Me Lazy</small></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Having taken<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x"> Harvard's Programming Course on edX</a>, I became conditioned to having a wide array of resources at my disposal. And I mean a wide array: The lectures given by<a href="http://cs.harvard.edu/malan/about/"> David Malan</a> were really interesting and engaging (not to say that Patrick Henry Winston's aren't); CS50x had hour-long tutorials that delved deeper into the lecture topics; there were short videos that discussed individual concepts; but most importantly - There was a massive community to discuss problems.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So lesson learned - a community (amongst other resources) is simply something I just can't do without. Thus for the sake of maintaining my sanity, I'm going to abort MIT's AI course and opt in to<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/artificial-intelligence-uc-berkeleyx-cs188-1x-0"> UC Berkeley's AI course on edX</a>. From experience, having peers to work through problems will allow me to learn just as much, but in a much smaller timeframe.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The course doesn't start until February 6, which allows me to focus on both my venture idea and<a href="https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course/"> web-development class</a>.</p>

<h2><small>I Need To Work On My Presentation Skills</small></h2>
<p dir="ltr">I pitched my venture idea to my<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/conrad-business-entrepreneurship-technology/undergraduate-students/undergraduate-courses#BET300"> University of Waterloo Entrepreneurship class</a>. I believe I did a good job, but there is substantial room for improvement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I get a second chance to pitch the idea once I've refined it using a business model canvas and value proposition canvas, as well as meetings with an advisor.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I'll soon be posting more info on my venture idea.</p>

<h2><small>I Need To Become More Efficient With My Time</small></h2>
<p dir="ltr">I can't help but think that<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law"> Parkinson's Law</a> is really applicable to my current circumstance. So for the next month I will make sure to follow more stringent rules<a href="http://selfcontrolapp.com/"> and tools</a> that will allow me to finish work quicker.</p>
Cheers.
