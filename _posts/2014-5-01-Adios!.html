With the month of April coming to an end, my internship wrapping up this Friday, my second semester of third year beginning next week, and a whole change in my schedule approaching, I think it is time I bid this website's current structure farewell.

It has been a great experience having written a post every other day. I've noticed considerable improvements in my writing ability, but as I flip the page and move onto a new chapter in my life, so too must this story end.

This journal-blog will eventually transform into something else, only time will tell what that something else ends up being.
