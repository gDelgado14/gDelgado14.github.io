I came across a status asking for motivation to finish an assignment as I guiltily scrolled through Facebook. To assist I posted this image:
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://giorgiodelgado.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/slcDD4N.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-292 aligncenter" title="Some Motivation For The Mornings" alt="slcDD4N" src="http://giorgiodelgado.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/slcDD4N.jpg" width="480" height="690" /></a></p>
<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">But what if getting out of bed, sleeping early, doing your homework, getting a workout, improving in some way, meeting new people, and exploring new things on a daily basis seems like a far-fetched vision that only exists in the imaginary world of movies? I'm here to tell you that you can do all of these things in a consistent manner by simply tweaking some of your habits.</span>

The main cause for one's inability to achieve productivity is the overconsumption of information. We are constantly bombarded with stimulating visuals and provoking text that prevent clarity of thought. Thus, undertaking a task that requires mental effort is almost a physical impossibility since our minds are already stuffed to the gils with waste.

<strong><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Reduce Distractions</span></strong>

The key then, is to remove oneself from this constant state of informational bombardment. If you are truly committed to being a better person with an ability to think clearly and the capacity to complete challenging goals, then you must forgo the sources of "noise".

Start small and gradually work your way into lesser and lesser distractions. To begin, I'd suggest you reduce your usage of social networking sites. This is where most of the mind numbingly useless information comes from, and ironically where people spend most of their time. Use <a href="http://www.bumblebeesystems.com/wastenotime/">blocking applications such as WasteNoTime</a>, which enforce productive habits.

<strong>Set Clearly Defined Goals</strong>

Once you've reduced the amount of mental clutter, a feeling of sharp clarity will consume you. The next step is to apply this newfound energy to good use. Have one or two clear-cut goals with actionable steps to constantly remind you of the desired outcomes. This clarity of thought is a double-edged sword in the sense that you can fall into the trap of a different kind of <a title="Controlling Information Overload" href="http://giorgiodelgado.ca/information-overload.html">mental overload</a>, something that I'm slowly learning to control. Heed my warning and beware of setting either too many objectives, or goals beyond your initial reach.

So get to it, turn your wishes into goals by reducing life's informational barrage, and outline these goals in actionable ways. Leave nothing to doubt, as you'll most likely end up wondering how life would have panned out had you been a more organized and productive person. Consider today as the first day of the rest of your life.
