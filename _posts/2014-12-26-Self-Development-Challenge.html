I have been quite interested in the pursuit of self-education for some time now.

Reading about self-taught entrepreneurs like Elon Musk, Emerson Spartz and Scott Young (in the video below) has made me curious to see how capable I am at teaching myself something completely out of my realm.

With that said, I've placed some really exciting goals for the next few months. I will seek to become:

<ul class="my-list">
  <li>A proficient programmer</li>
  <li>Knowledgeable in Artificial Intelligence</li>
  <li>Capable of creating my own software product</li>
</ul><br>



I'll begin blogging about my experiences once I embark on this journey.

Happy Holidays :)
