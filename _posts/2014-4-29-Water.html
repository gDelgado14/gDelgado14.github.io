As I write this, I'm wrapping up a refreshing stair climb situated within a tree-covered ravine. The 42 wooden steps that I lapped on blend perfectly with the surrounding forestry, and down below sits a calm stream that runs beyond eyesight. From start to finish, I was fully aware of the stream's presence but with headphones attached and music blaring, I did not fully encompass its voice. Only after my run did I turn my music off and began to listen. I then began to recall Bruce Lee's infamous quote:
<blockquote>Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless -- like water. Now you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup, you put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle, you put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">The more I listened, the more I contemplated.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Water can be anything it wants: It can soothe you. It can harm you. It can save you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Water can be cold, warm, solid, lightweight, and heavy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Water has seen, felt, sensed, and travelled beyond the capacity of any one human being.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Yet it is what you and I are mostly composed of.</p>
