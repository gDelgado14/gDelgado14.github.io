<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-76f76c13-3f09-f172-7504-91f8fec82a89">Besides the fact that I'm running on no sleep due to a family wedding, this whole week was spent developing my business idea.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I don't want to mention it yet, but I do have to pitch it to my class next week.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For those of you interested in starting your own businesses, these are the tools we were given to create rough ideas for our businesses.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Both the<a href="https://strategyzer.com/books"> Business Model Generation &amp; Value Proposition Design</a> books will teach you the fundamentals to create<a href="http://theleanstartup.com/"> LEAN</a> businesses.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another resource that I'm using right now is<a href="http://leanentrepreneur.co/"> this book</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the technical side, like I've said before, I'm learning web development through Udemy's<a href="https://www.udemy.com/complete-web-developer-course"> Complete Developer Course</a>. But my skills will only take me so far, and I hope I can meet a technical co-founder at University of Waterloo. So the advice here is; meet those that can help you create your product!</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since I no longer foresee any weddings or significant disturbances for the next four months, you will start to see more consistency in my blog posts (I'm considering a weekly post on Sundays) as well as a greater amount of work done. I'm behind on<a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/index.htm"> MIT's AI course</a> but I should get a few weeks ahead starting next week.</p>
Cheers.
