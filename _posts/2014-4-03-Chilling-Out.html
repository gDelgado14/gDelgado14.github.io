I find it very difficult to reject the opportunity to learn something new, or to go out of my comfort zone to expand my horizons. the undertaking of more tasks, however, impedes the progression of all goals currently in place.

<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1yww7v/living_off_savings_long_enough_to_attempt_to/cfou2m8">One post</a> I came across perfectly lines out what I mean by this. Here's  a quote from the post:
<blockquote>About a month before you planned to return to work you realize that you haven't achieved any of the things you set out to do, you wasted thousands of dollars that you could have spent on a fancy holiday or a new car, and the only thing you have to look forward to now is several more years of mind numbing work as you edge closer and closer towards your grave.</blockquote>
I think the above perfectly lines out my greatest fear - not achieving what I set out to do. And it seems very real when I watch my self uncontrollably take on more than I can handle, which leads me to the brink of mental overload. What I'm slowly realizing is that it's better to be the master of one or two things <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/21fu6c/i_want_to_feel_like_a_master_of_one_skillhobby/cgcrvsp">rather than being a jack of all trades</a>, but master of none.

Slowing down, reflecting on current goals, and then continuing on the path to those goals is the key. Doing too much will <a title="Diminishing Marginal Returns To Life" href="http://giorgiodelgado.ca/diminishing-marginal-returns-to-life.html">diminish your capabilities</a> to the point of zero accomplishment.
