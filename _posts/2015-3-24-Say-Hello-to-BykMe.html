As of today, <a href="https://bykme.sharetribe.com/">BykMe</a> is live! 

I'm excited to announce that this summer you will be able to rent out your bicycle to anybody using this platform! 

I'm working with an engineering friend of mine to include hardware into the mix so that eventually you'll be able to track your device and lock it remotely. 

I'm looking for beta testers and people willing to actually rent out their bikes. If interested, simply sign up for BykMe, message me saying you're willing to rent out your bike this Spring/Summer, and I'll grant you the required permissions. 

Cheers.
