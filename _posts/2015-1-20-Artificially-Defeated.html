<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-76f76c13-3f0b-6756-7d51-4feea7462037">After two grueling days of suffering, I finally finished the<a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/assignments/MIT6_034F10_lab0.pdf"> first problem set</a> of<a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/index.htm"> MIT's AI course</a> and all I can say is WOW is it ever harder than<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x"> CS50x</a> but just as rewarding!</p>
I want to show my work in some way but I haven't really thought about the best way to do so. I may create a<a href="https://github.com/"> GitHub</a> account even though I have no idea how<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29"> Git</a> actually works just to introduce myself to another useful programming tool... that or I could just slap the code on another page here. Not much of a concern for now.
