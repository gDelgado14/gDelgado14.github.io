<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-71a18ca4-3f0f-e661-7b14-86129480cb09">Lots has happened between my last post and now. From expanding my professional network and creating meaningful connections, to<a href="http://giorgiodelgado.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Screen-Shot-2015-01-24-at-4.21.28-PM.png"> finalizing my product's registration page</a>, to<a href="https://twitter.com/Giorgio_Delgado/status/562347062524911616"> hanging out with really influential people</a>. I'll summarize what has transpired.</p>

<h2><small>Network Network Network</small></h2>
<p dir="ltr">I've been jumping on any opportunity to meet tech enthusiasts and startup cofounders. One of the best events that I went to was the<a href="http://www.uwesociety.com/blog/entsoc-presents-startup-showcase-winter-2015"> Startup Showcase</a> where I met a bunch of cofounders as well fellow laurier entrepreneurs from<a href="http://laurierentrepreneur.ca/launchpad/"> LaunchPad</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Being a fitness enthusiast, I've got to say that<a href="http://www.oneset.co/"> OneSet</a> took the prize for me. If you love working out and are always looking for cool workout ideas, then you'll love this app.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other notable startups were:</p>

<ul>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.yellowbrickme.ca/">YellowBrickMe</a></p>
</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.suncayr.ca/">Suncayr</a></p>
</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.chalk.com/">Chalk</a></p>
</li>
	<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://getkue.ca/">Kue</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><small>Get Inspired</small></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Besides the awesome networking events that I went to, I also attended two really great talks. The first one was a rather provocative talk by UW's<a href="https://www.ted.com/speakers/larry_smith"> Larry Smith</a> on the mentality necessary to change the world. If you've never had a chance to hear him talk, I recommend<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/larry_smith_why_you_will_fail_to_have_a_great_career?language=en"> this video</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although quite abstract, his talk made each and every one of us question things we assume as fundamental truths, as well as realize that to make meaningful changes in this world, one has to be prepared to face very uncomfortable situations.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The second talk I attended was an informal chat through<a href="http://brucecroxon.com/bio/"> Bruce Croxon's</a> past and current entrepreneurial endeavours. He discussed how he went about creating Lavalife, and what he learned. Lessons:</p>

<ul class="my-list">
<li>Do what you love (because times will get unimaginably tough)</li>

<li>A good culture is immensely important for the long-term performance of your company</li>

<li>User acquisition means nothing without solid retention</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>Listening to successful people like Bruce and Larry always helps to keep me grounded when I question what the hell I'm doing trying to start a company and not just get a regular job.</p>

<h2><small>Product-Market Fit!!!!!</small></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Going to networking events and talking about my venture idea has provided me with some decent feedback. But I definitely need to get out there and start talking to more people to get a sense of their demand for my product. In any case, what matters most is<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product"> getting my product out there as soon as possible</a>.</p>

<h2><small>Coding Like There's No Tomorrow</small></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Besides all of these happenings, I've just been learning about web development and programming. These skills have helped me immeasurably, and I hope that by the end of this week I'll have my website up and running with a functioning back-end.</p>
Cheers
