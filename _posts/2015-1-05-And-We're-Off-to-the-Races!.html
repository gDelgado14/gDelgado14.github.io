<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-76f76c13-3f03-740f-408b-524f9d4c45d5">Today marks day one of the<a href="http://giorgiodelgado.ca/self-development-challenge-the-plan/"> Self Development Challenge</a> and I've got to say how exciting it feels once again to start yet another interesting course. There are considerable differences between<a href="http://cs.harvard.edu/malan/"> David Malan's</a> (Harvard's CS50 Professor) and<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Winston"> Patrick Winston's</a> (MIT's Artificial Intelligence Professor) teaching styles, but they are both highly inspiring people.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although substantially more mathematical than<a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x"> CS50</a>, MIT's<a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/index.htm"> Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</a> will not only strengthen my mathematical skills but provide me with a greater understanding of the way decisions are made, and serve to strengthen my skills as an Economics Major.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After this course I will know how to make simple representations of the human mind with the help of<a href="https://www.python.org/about/"> Python</a>. I'll try to post with greater detail as I progress throughout the term.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here is the first lecture to the Artificial Intelligence course.</p>
