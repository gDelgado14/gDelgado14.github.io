Meditation is something I definitely don't do enough of. On the odd occasion in which I have given it an honest attempt, I always come out with a refreshed mind. Being an active individual, this has also made me consider doing yoga, which I may look into once the summer begins.

For people like me who have next to no experience in meditation, it is nearly impossible to maintain an empty mind for <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/2379z8/i_have_real_bad_adhd_and_have_an_exceptionally/cgu65bw?context=3">more than a few seconds</a> - the attention deficit that has resulted from our high-information generation. Thankfully, however, there is <a href="http://www.calm.com/">a website that walks you through</a> and helps you maintain zen for the duration of the meditation. If it weren't for this site, I'd end up with a mind far from empty (which is the goal in meditation), and thus ruin the whole exercise. Finishing a cycle will give you vigor and clarity of mind to either start your day, or diminish your day's accumulated stress.

I can't name off all the benefits since I personally have experience very little, but I can say that I always feel energized, and with a mental clarity that allows me to focus on what needs to be done, not to mention that stress is completely abolished once you come back into consciousness.
