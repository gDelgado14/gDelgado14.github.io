I've been working on a few things all at once so progression on everything hasn't been as quick as I had hoped. Like I mentioned on [this post](http://giorgiodelgado.ca/page3/), I wanted to learn something new and was not happy with the slow latency of my blog so I decided to switch over from Wordpress to Jekyll hosted on GitHub Pages. 

### git + python + blogging practice

The whole process of moving the site was awesome experience in programming and software management. I got good practice playing around with git as well as got to create a script that organized the XML output from a WordPress export into jekyll-ready content. <a href="https://github.com/gDelgado14/soup">Here's</a> the repository if you're interested in how I did it (caveat: it is far from perfect but it did however get the job done for me). I'll write a more detailed post this coming week as to how the script came about.

### TO-DO

- Fix broken links on [Forty Eight](http://giorgiodelgado.ca/forty-eight/). My python script may be able to solve this issue. 
- Fix Navbar
- Maybe add search feature
- Link to my [GitHub](https://github.com/gDelgado14)
