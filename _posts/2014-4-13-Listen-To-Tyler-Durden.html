Tyler only speaks truths with this phrase, "The things you own end up owning you". I'd like to believe that material possessions are a supplement to our being, but more often than not we tend to place more importance on inanimate objects as opposed to those things which bring to us the most value in life.

I recently listened to<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XofumNQMqA"> Earl Nightingale's "The Strangest Secret"</a>, and it he said something that I couldn't agree with more:
<blockquote>The problem is that our mind comes as standard equipment at birth. It's free. And

things that are given to us for nothing, we place little value on. Things that we pay

money for, we value.</blockquote>
Untrained human cognition takes for granted the things which we don't work hard towards, we're just wired that way. With this in mind, then it makes total sense that we throw away the most valuable things and place greater importance on those things with monetary value.

Once you realize the toxicity and distraction that flows from materialism, then you can begin to work towards something of value. Start placing more importance on family, friends, and [inner] self.
