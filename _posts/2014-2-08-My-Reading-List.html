Like previously mentioned, <a title="The Starbucks Alternative" href="http://giorgiodelgado.ca/the-starbucks-alternative.html">I'm all about continual self improvement</a>. But much like the show "Hoarders", I too have a problem with letting things go. In my case, however, it's information. The second I see a useful link, newsletter, or potential tap for knowledge I immediately note it down. For links, I save them into my reading list. Newsletters, I click on the subscribe button. But books, that's where the real hoarding happens. I always hear, or read about recommendations and invariably write them down. This tendency of mine has somewhat hindered my ability to stay focused on one task. I figured, then, that at least someone out there may use my ever expanding book list to better use.

Here are the current books I have in either digital or physical form that I have yet to read:
<ul>

I did not bother showing the inordinate amount of finanicial academic research papers or other quantitative financial literature.

And with this list, you can begin to see where my aspirations lie.

Hopefully this list gives you something to read, because I doubt this backlog will be cleared by me any time soon. As previously mentioned, I have another list of more technical books and journal articles. If you wish to attain this list, please contact me.
