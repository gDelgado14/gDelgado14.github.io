<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-71a18ca4-3f1e-50c4-4a10-4de58020ebe7">With the sheer amount of things running around in my head I simply had to figure out a way to organize, categorize and prioritize.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Of course there are apps, web applications, mentors, and a myriad of other ways to relief stress and increase productivity when it comes to managing multiple tasks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But as<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/occam.html"> Occam</a> would say, the simplest method is often the most efficient.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That is why I have begun writing just about everything down in actionable ways. I can't be the only one here whose mind begins to race at the seemingly insurmountable amount of things required to be done in order to achieve a certain goal, and more so if the goal is a rather lofty one.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is imperative that items be actionable and not vague. Writing down (as I have before) "Python CodeCademy" is useless and can't even be verified for completion. A more efficient item on a to do list would go along the lines of, "Finish Intro To Classes Module". Then I can check - Did I finish this module? Why or Why Not? Should I get more granular? ... and so on.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There's something special about writing things as well. I can't quite put my finger on it (no pun intended), but when pen meets paper my concerns seem to vanish as my ideas take on simpler form.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once all is jotted down, I categorize and look at what needs to be done and what is fluff.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Combined with my calendar, where I've made it a habit to include all my deadlines, meetings, and other tasks, I can prioritize my list items based on urgency and importance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And when something doesn't get finished. It simply gets moved onto the following day's To Do list, which is compiled the night before.</p>
Voila, productivity increased.
