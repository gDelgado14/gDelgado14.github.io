A common rule of thumb in the rule of investments states that the greater the returns on a stock, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk%E2%80%93return_spectrum">the greater your risk</a>.

If you look at the more established companies, otherwise known as "Blue Chips", you can almost foretell with great certainty that they will neither implode (ahem ... unless your name is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Stearns">Bear Stearns</a>) nor reach for the stars.

Conversely, only in hindsight could you have said that Apple had what it took to rise into greatness.

This brought me to start thinking about one's life as a collection of metaphorical stocks representing our memories. When you look at all the great and learned men, most (but not all) faced great adversity to reach perfection. They could have thrown in the towel or alternatively chosen to plunge into the abyss of uncertainty in the aim to achieve greatness. Surely, these people must have known that failure loomed much nearer than anything resembling achievement, but the risk was worth the high return of knowing that they would be doing something that mattered. 

In this sense, if your portfolio of memories doesn't even keep pace with inflation, then it's time to start reconsidering whether a change in attitude is in menu. Jeff Bezos simplifies this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwG_qR6XmDQ">very succinctly</a>.
