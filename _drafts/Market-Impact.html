For those like me who have just began dabbling in financial markets or those who are considering getting into the world of capital markets, there's a crucial but often disregarded concept known as Market Impact.

One's own eagerness and lack of patience to either buy or sell a stock puts an unnoticed additional charge to your assets. Consequently, your return on that asset is decreased. If you are desperate to buy a share, you will not mind having to pay a higher price than the quoted price in order to persuade anyone holding the share to part with the asset.

Thus, if you were to buy 1,000 shares of a stock, which you unnecessarily paid an additional $0.05 per share. You have just costed yourself $50.00 in just one trade. That $50.00 is the value of market impact.
