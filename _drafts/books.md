Reading is just as important to a happy life as a balanced diet. 

Here's a list of some of the books that have given me deep insights. 


##Siddhartha

####Herman Hesse

I've read this book a few times now and each time I come out with a reinvigorated desire to explore without fear.

##Man's Search for Meaning

####Viktor Frankl

If you think you're going through a tough time, then read this book and you'll realize how spoilt you are.

##Life if Pi

#### ???

In a world of extremists, this story gives you a refreshing take on the world. That all religions can coexist, and in fact that subscribing to multiple religions perpetuates your love and passion for each one.

##1984

####George Orwell

Very cliche but it's got to be said that Orwell made some strikingly accurate predictions about the State's perverse obsession with societal control all wrapped up in a riveting story.

##Zen & the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance

####Robert Persig

Unbelievably deep book. Read it if you want to get a start into modern philosophy.

##The Art of Learning

####Josh Waitzkin

It's actually quite odd to realize that most of us don't work on our learning methodology - we just assumed learning ability is this fixed thing. This book has far reaching implications that span farther than just improving your learning ability.
