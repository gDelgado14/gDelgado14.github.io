Naiveté is a double edged sword. On the one hand, it permits you to attempt things you would've never done had you grasped the sheer difficulty of the task at hand. Conversely, naiveté leaves you stranded once you've reached the cusp of your understanding, at which point you're faced with loneliness and complexity beyond what you could have ever imagined.

Once you're staring straight at the void and have no guidance, there are two options:

- Return to a predefined life (i.e. get a career, which holds considerably less variability in income)
- Embrace the void and start becoming comfortable with uncomfortableness  

The latter of which is the central tenet to entrepreneurship. 

Note, entrepreneurship is not just about starting a company. It's at the core of creativity and passion. Painting because you love painting and don't care about the financial implications of such an action can be defined as entrepreneurial. 

Adversity is another element of entrepreneurship. 

###Burning Your Boats
We are currently in a rather prosperous economic time. The markets are healthy and the risk of attempting entrepreneurship is quite low (just look at all the different entrepreneurship programs widely available at schools and other institutions, as well as the swaths of capital available up for grabs).

But I see this increase in entrepreneurship as facetious. I even question my desire to do high-risk endeavours. Is it just because everyone else is doing it? Or do I truly like the autonomy and additional perks that come with entrepreneurship.

I think a good indication of whether you're serious or just pretending is whether you've got exit plans already in line in case things go awry. To me, that's a massive red flag. 

If you're truly serious about a high risk endeavour, you've already done a thorough assessment of the risks you're undertaking and **have come to terms with the subsequent implications** - in which case you're so focused on succeeding that you don't have time to plan some sort of safety net. The opportunity costs of not thinking about your entrepreneurial livelihood are way too high. 

I suggest then that you **burn your boats**. Ensure that either you give it your all and win, or you give it your all and end up in a disagreeable situation (hint: things will be alright either way).  

###On Cofounders
Do work, then assess compatibility. 

NDA's are pretentious. Don't start acting as though a thought (ideas are just fading thoughts, remember) is so important that you're willing to bind people legally to that thought. I'm not a lawyer but I presume fading thoughts can't be legally protected - regardless of whether there's a piece of paper (business plan) related to that thought.

I'd argue most NDA's are a hindrance to society and exist mainly for the sake of self perpetuating the thing that issued the NDA. The net benefit to society is thus negative. Think of the whole rather than just a part of the whole. Obviously there are useful cases for NDA's but not as often as one would think.


###On Careers
I regret not having joined a fast growing company initially. The lack of experience significantly reduced my chances of succeeding in something that already comes with a relatively low chance of success. Joining a fast-growing company is one of the best learning experiences a hopeful entrepreneur could have. 


###On Ulterior Motives

Brainstorming sessions of any kind, regardless of how productive they may seem, will never yield truths worthy of creating massively successful companies. This is because massively successful companies are so out of the ordinary that they're the very first ideas to get tossed in the can. 

Massively successful companies also start in such a small market that they come off as simple hobbies or lifestyle businesses.

Great companies start off from humble beginnings, and the founders are never seeking to become CEO's - it's just an inadvertent consequence of intellectual curiosity at its purest form. I think the best example of this is Larry Page's endeavour to see if current page ranking algorithms were outputting good search results. The rest is history. 

But to think that you'd be able to conjure an idea and then proceed to write out a business plan outlining your step-by-step process to an IPO is simply an exercise in pointing out your ignorance of the world's complexity. 

This also applies to the lean startup methodology - which bears some merit if your goal is incremental progress. 

Most consumers don't know what they want, so iterating on their own feedback is simply giving them an improved version of something that already exists. Consumers aren't good at conjuring effective business ideas from non-existence.


###Embrace Discomfort
Real learning can be felt at every point when you feel truly uncomfortable with the task at hand. This pertains to any situation, whether it be while reading a book or in a social situation that puts you way out of your comfort zone. 

So if you feel discomfort, embrace it and know that this is the sort of feeling you should be experiencing on a daily basis. 

You're simply learning. 

If you seize to feel discomfort, you've essentially stopped living.

###Final Thoughts
Labels prevent creativity. 

By studying entrepreneurship and defining it using some framework or mental model prevents outside-the-box thining. And that's where the magic truly happens.
