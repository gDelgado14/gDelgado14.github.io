I've developed the odd habit of writing out numerous blog posts in text documents on my Mac because I've been intending on switching my hosting. I'm slowly learning git and I'd like to immerse myself even more by using jekyll and github pages. 

But I digress ... I got a really interesting though that I'd like to share. 

Much like all of us develop certain eating habits, with their good or bad connotations depending on the habits themselves, there are reprecusisons that arise from these eating habits. 

A healthy and nutritional diet leads to a healthy and vigorous body. It is one's own responsibility to maintain a good eating regimen so as to sustain the demands of the body and prolong its healthy state. There is a lot of conscious effort that goes into doing this; you avoid temptations and sacrifice your favorite meals in place of scheduled nutrional snacks - but all for the better. 

WIth this in mind, doesn't the same apply to our minds? 

I believe it's ones own responsibility to ensure a healthy mind full of amazing thoughts. Like I mentioned before, your mind is an input output machine. 

Once at a certain age, you don't depend on your elders to continue feeding you. So why do you still completely depend on others to educate you and tell you what to think. If you care about your mind and it's potential, then it's advisable that you start taking responsibility for it. 

Much like a strict diet with short term pains and long term gains, the same applies to feeding your mind with the propper information. It's definately not easy, but once you build momentum the habit becomes self sustaining. 




Doing what you want when you want is also the essence of happiness. Just like curiosity is at the core of happiness.
