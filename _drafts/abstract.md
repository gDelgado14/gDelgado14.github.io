title: Abstract Thoughts

I don't know if it's just me but I truly believe that abstract ideas allow one to think more creatively. That's why I've grown to like mathematics and its seemingly unrepeatable complexity. 

One such concept in mathematics that drives many people to dislike math is asymptotic notation. This is the analysis on functions and behaviour as variables tend towards infinity. 

Peter Thiel is renown for saying how he wants to live forever. If we use that concept as our function and analyze this behaviour as age tends to infinity we can begin to hypothesize as to what might occur down the road if Peter's dream comes true.
