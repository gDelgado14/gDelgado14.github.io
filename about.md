> Just as there are odors that dogs can smell and we cannot, as well as sounds that dogs can hear and we cannot, so too there are wavelengths of light we cannot see and flavors we cannot taste. Why then, given our brains wired the way they are, does the remark, "Perhaps there are thoughts we cannot think," surprise you? - [Richard Hamming](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004020)
