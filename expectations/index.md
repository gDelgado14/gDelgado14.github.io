> Note: **This is a VERY rough draft of this post. Do not treat it as anything more than useless mental notes that I have scribbled and decided to share.**

Razor Suleman, the newly-appointed (and now recently [resigned](http://betakit.com/razor-suleman-resigns-as-next-canada-ceo-andrea-matheson-joins-as-co-president/)) CEO of the Next 36 program (recently rebranded as Next Canada) spoke to my cohort about his experiences as the founder of [Achievers](http://www.achievers.com/). His company began in Canada and eventually moved to California. The difference in ambition between his Canadian and American employees was noticeable. When Razor asked his Canadian workforce if Achievers could become a $1 Billion dollar company, his employees were noticeably skeptic of ever achieving such a valuation, and suggested Razor reassess his company's goals. When Achievers' American counterparts were asked the very same question, they responded with, "only $1 Billion"?

Canada is an amazing place. "The American Dream" as it is known across the world, is [starting to decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_inequality_in_the_United_States#Statistics), and with that a new home of dreams and infinite possibility is emerging within Canada. The gentrification of the poor and the syphoning of wealth to the very richest is preventing hopeful Americans from acting on their ambitions. So it's now up to us as Canadians who live in a fairer (albeit imperfect) society to continue where Americans left off.

I have yet to distill all of the lessons from my experience as a participant in the [Next 36 program](https://www.nextcanada.com/next-36). However, the program's overarching hypothesis has influenced my perception of Canadian culture. And this hypothesis states **that Canadians are too risk averse; to the detriment of their society's own well-being**.

Here's a diagram of said theory:

<img src="/downloads/risk.jpg" alt="canada and us risk profiles" class="portrait-img">

Here we compare American risk tolerance with that of Canadians. We use Americans as the base measurement since they have the largest GDP in the world and are notoriously known as risk takers. 

Note that there is no data that actually supports the above distribution. Rather, this is an inferred depiction of risk profiles of the American and Canadian population based on the experiences of the founders of Next Canada. This is a purely anecdotal, but plausible, risk profile distribution.

I wholeheartedly believe this theory. It's one that is hard to prove one way or the other. Considering the little data I provide, this post must be taken with a grain of salt and is purely anecdotal.

Reza Satchu, the Chairman of Next Canada, talks about his experiences: Having gone to school at McGill and then worked at Merrill Lynch, he said how peculiar it was that his American colleagues (all of which attended prestigious academic institutions) had much higher ambitions and expectations of themselves compared to his McGill classmates. This is odd considering that his Canadian classmates were as smart, if not smarter, than any of his Ivy League colleagues.

Take a McGill graduate and a Harvard graduate and wait 10 years. The general outcome is that the Harvard grad will have taken on more risk and perhaps started an impactful venture. Even if it turns out that Canadians open up more businesses, it's not enough that Canadians start more companies. Who knows. Maybe Canadians do start more companies. But the ambitions of these companies aren't as grandiose as those of American ones. We set a ceiling on how high we can go from the outset. Why?) is that the Harvard grad will have attempted to start a company – or intends to do so in the near future – while the McGill graduate will have ended up with a steady career (most likely at an American company). The economic implications of this are massive.

Canadian employees are just more risk averse. And what does that do for the Canadian economy? The tamer ambitions of the Canadian worker lead a company to accomplish much less than an american counterpart. When you don't believe you can achieve something, why put in the effort?

The standard pattern is this: Canadians work for American companies. This leads to less jobs in Canada and a lower standard of living. 

Many a cashless entrepreneur has tried to seek financing in Canada because of the risk profile of the founders' ventures. Despite these assessments, American investors end up fronting the first investment. It's not like they're privy to some undisclosed information that wasn't mentioned to the Canadian investors. They're just more risk averse. There is no such thing as a "Sequoia of Canada". 

RIM was founded with Canadian capital, but this is the exception, not the rule for large Canadian Success stories. Shopify (the new Canadian business darling, got it's Series A funding [entirely](https://techvibes.com/2015/09/04/a-brief-history-of-shopify-2015-09-04) from American venture firms). In fact, it was only [after](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/small-business/sb-money/a-rare-startup-success-story-shopify-hits-1-billion-milestone/article15892998/) the Series A that Canadian financing came into play.

Risk aversion runs deeply in Canada, and a strong preference for safety over everything is ubiquitous. As someone born outside of Canada who experienced a different culture for quite some time, it's clear to see how obsessed Canadians are about their health and safety. An obsession so radical that it sucks the life right out of many situations. Consider how when one child gets hurt in a playground using a certain type of shoe, or scarf, whatever. That item is forever banned for as long as that school exists. What sort of policy is that? This sort of radicalism is pervasive in many areas of Canadian culture.

Look at Canadian finance vs American finance. When a Canadian goes bankrupt, there are harsher penalties for the perpetrator in comparison to the American. This is a incentive toward financial conservatism.

Canadian policies are inherently more risk averse. The political barriers that a Canadian company needs to overcome in order to release a product are materially higher compared to American political barriers. One such example is consumer protection policy.   

> maybe talk about the idea of standard deviation and mean with respect to Canadian and american prosperity. 

Much has been said about the future of Canadian prosperity. I for one hope the Liberals enforce aggressive policies to create a culture that is willing to at least consider trying something new and unique, knowing that it will all be alright, no matter what happens.

> On Averages of standard of living and the standard deviation of the distributions of US and Canada ... Canada has little standard deviation of certain standards, which is a result of the risk aversion of the society.

> We don't have as many heroes to look up to, and thus when a student from Wilfrid Laurier University hears me say that they are just as capable as any Ivy League student in making a significant impact, my sanity gets questioned. There are diminishing returns to the capital at hand that a founder has. Also, the [democratization of technology](https://stratechery.com/2015/venture-capital-and-the-internets-impact/) allows non-affluent people to now have the same impact as founders who come from affluent families (who essentially become the first investors in companies, a la Elon Musk). This is also the case for hardware companies, who now have vast [funding channels](https://hax.co/) 

> talk about bankrupcy penalties in Canada are larger than those of USA, thus incentivizing conservatism in business decisions in Canada.
