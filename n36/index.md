I'm fortunate to be part of the [Next 36](https://www.thenext36org.ca/thenext36/program-info) 2016 cohort and would like to document my experience throughout this program.

I will be posting weekly recaps discussing what I learned.

### About N36

The Next 36 program is broken into two phases.

Phase 1 is from January until April, in which participants are left to their own devices to find their cofounders (if they don't already have a venture), and work for the next four months to have a somewhat developed idea by the start of the Summer.

Phase 2 brings all Next 36ers to Toronto from May until August for an intensive training program taught by seasoned entrepreneurs and renowned academics in the field of technology and innovation. Of course, the primary goal is still to continue developing your venture throughout the training program. The idea is that you apply what you learn in class directly to your venture so as to increase the company's chances of success.

Throughout the entire program there are opportunities to raise up to $50,000 based on progress, traction, and other metrics.

### Phase 1 recap

I got accepted into the Next 36 program in December 2015 and was immediately tasked with deciding what company I would pitch to the Next 36.

At the time, I was working on a Peer-to-Peer bicycle renting network that connected bicycle owners with people looking for short, medium, and long-term bike rentals. The obvious answer was to continue working on this business .

Shortly thereafter I realized things were [not going to work out]({% post_url 2016-04-24-bye-bykme %}) for BykMe so I made the decision to start looking for other opportunities and partnered up with two friends of mine that I knew were well suited for the intensity of startups. From January until March we worked on a tool for creative agencies (Marketers, Advertisers, Designers) to manage their communications (click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6_A8be9iqvHSTgtMmhWNWZ4TDA/view?pref=2&pli=1) for our slide deck).

Long story short; we realized [Agile Development](http://agilemethodology.org/) and [Lean Management](http://www.lean.org/WhatsLean/), on top of all the existing project management software such as Basecamp and Asana, left very little room for a new solution in this space so we began looking for other opportunities.

### Phase 2 Begins

*Read [here](http://giorgiodelgado.ca/n36/) to learn about the two phases of the Next 36 program.*

Two emerging markets that piqued our interest were Artificial Intelligence and chat bots.

I don't want to go into too much detail yet because we're still refining the product on a daily basis, but we are of the opinion that [Slack](https://medium.com/@benbrown/slack-is-the-operating-system-6bae1a6c0291#.uy0ttsepl) is a great vehicle to break into a very promising market.

Saturday May 7 marked the beginning of Phase 2. I got paired to room with a data scientist, a health nutrition entrepreneur, and a hacker with a knack for [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) ... pretty cool.

#### Strategy & Innovation: Session 1

On May 9, we had our first class - Strategy & Innovation, by [Ajay Agrawal](http://www.agrawal.ca/).

Prof. Agrawal discussed the usefulness in viewing entrepreneurship from the lens of economics. Specifically, he discussed an interesting property of technology businesses; Increasing Marginal Returns.

Basically, Increasing Marginal Returns means that every additional unit of your product is more valuable than the previous unit.

Contrast this to farming. For each additional unit of corn, there is less and less land to produce the corn. Not to mention that sustained demand will reduce the quality of the soil, thereby reducing the quality of the corn.

In essence, almost all technology businesses (especially software - AI is a prime candidate) demonstrate Increasing Marginal Returns.

Consider the value of social networks. If none of your friends are using a social network, then what use is it to you. Conversely, if all your friends are on a social network (i.e. most recently Snapchat), then you'll feel a bit of [FOMO](https://www.google.ca/search?q=fomo&oq=fomo&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l4j69i59.479j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) if you're not on it as well.

In other words, social networks have, well, network effects. This brings up an interesting point - businesses that utilize network effects tend to consume entire markets.

The most obvious example is Facebook. They have no competitors because their user base reached a certain level in the early years of the company to make the value of their network exponentially better on each additional user.

This also explains why Facebook paid so much to acquire Instagram. The story goes that the social network giant noticed that the most used feature on Facebook was sharing photos. As such, Instagram was doing a hell of a lot better job than they were at satisfying their users' demands.

If Instagram would have continued as a startup, they may have entrenched themselves as the go-to social network, eventually making Facebook obsolete. From Facebook's perspective, there is no price to high to prevent extinction.

For a much better explanation, see [this](https://hbr.org/1996/07/increasing-returns-and-the-new-world-of-business) HBR article discussing the new economics of the modern world.

Prof. Agrawal also went into detail about breaking down a consumer's [willingness to pay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willingness_to_pay) mathematically to demonstrate the importance of network effects in a venture opportunity.

#### Economics of Entrepreneurship: Session 1

On May 12 we had our second class taught  by [Reza Satchu](https://www.thenext36org.ca/org/whos-involved/reza-satchu) (more on [Reza](https://www.alumni.hbs.edu/stories/Pages/story-bulletin.aspx?num=3716)).

The class began with an introduction and history of the N36 program, and its [high] expectations on its participants.

Which brings me to the following image:

<img src="/downloads/risk.jpg" alt="canada and us risk profiles" class="portrait-img">

> Re-rendering of Next 36 diagram.

This diagram is a hypothetical depiction of Americans' capacity to tolerate risk versus Canadians.

If you were to take two identical people (identical in every respect: Education; income; family; opportunities for growth; etc.), but one was American and one was Canadian, the American would be more likely than the Canadian to start a company.

Now, I'm not here to say whether this is factually true or not - that's besides the point. But it is a rather intriguing proposition. And perhaps this is the reason that most massively influential companies come out of the United States and not Canada. And if that's the case, why not try and do something about it by taking on bigger risks?

Obviously there are other variables at play such as bigger financial penalties for bankruptcy in Canada vs U.S. and . Regardless, the world is our Oyster, Canada.

So after this introduction, Reza went on to begin the actual class.

Reza walked us through his logic in how he managed to create an innovative business in an unassuming industry - [self storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_storage).

Essentially this is how it happened:

- Reza and his brother had just sold [SupplierMarket](http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=34950)
- He was driving alongside the highway
- Noticed a string of self storage locations in the outskirts of town all in close proximity
- He **stopped the car** to see why there were competing businesses located besides each other and so far away from their customer base
- He talked to the staff to learn about compensation and customer service
- Reza noticed that these business were at maximum capacity, which is odd since their most valued asset is space - how could you not have space unless you're underpricing your asset
- Talked to customers to learn about their preferences and behaviours
- Realized market was highly segmented (no market leader)
- Found two customer segments willing to pay for quality and convenience (commercial and high income consumer)
- Purchased a plot of land in urban area
- Developed a high quality, upscale, close-proximity self storage business to cater to the aforementioned customer segments
- A lot of money flowed in
- The industry radically changed (was previously just mom and pops - compared to highly consolidated U.S. market) and brought in strong competition because entrepreneurs now saw that this industry had the potential to provide high returns

The key takeaway here is that as an entrepreneur, one has to be very observant of their surroundings. There are opportunities everywhere, but you have to be mindful enough to simply notice them.

Additionally, we as entrepreneurs have limited resources. It is up to us to gain the most insight as quickly as possible for as little as possible. The advent of the internet allows anyone to do just that. The problem is, not many people have the initiative to actually do it.  

Note here that Reza didn't spend a lot of money to glean all of this information. He simply had the presence of mind to **stop the car** and inquire about something peculiar.

And just like anyone else would say, talk to your users.


### Onwards and Upwards

My cofounders and I made significant progress this week as a venture and aim to begin pitching our business to anyone who's willing to hear next week.

Stay tuned for more updates :)
